# Edge-Detection-of-an-ImageFile-using-Numpy
It is program which detects the edge of an RGB (.jpg, .png etc.) image, without the use of Scikit learn library.

Edge Detection: 
                  Edge detection is an image processing technique for finding the boundaries of objects within images. It works by detecting discontinuities in brightness. Edge detection is used for image segmentation and data extraction in areas such as image processing, computer vision, and machine vision.
                  
Types of edges:
Generally edges are of three types: Horizontal edges, Vertical Edges and Diagonal Edges. In this program I mainly focussed into evaluating the Verical edges and Horizontal edge of the Image file, using various Numpy operations. 

Why detect edges ?
                Most of the shape information of an image is enclosed in edges. So first we detect these edges in an image and by using these filters and then by enhancing those areas of image which contains edges, sharpness of the image will increase and image will become clearer.
                
The whole program is solely developed to showcase my programming skills in Python programming language, especially Numpy. The program could have been smaller if it was developed using Scikit learn Python module, but I chose to develop it showing the exact idea behind the whole thing of Detecting the edges. And the funny and amazing thing I knew that an image file is a Numpy array. A image can represented as an array of numbers. 

Data Visualization:
                    The Python module called Matplotlib is used to visualize the image file. Two imports such as matplotlib.pyplot and matplotlib.image can be seen in the source code. Matplotlib is a Python library used for Data Visualiztaion.
                    
Thank you for reading.
